                            <p>It started when we noticed that fractional CISO services were our most in-demand offerings on our Cybersecurity Marketplace. That insight pushed us to actively onboard experienced vCISOs. One of the standout professionals we connected with was XXXXXX, then the CISO at XXXXXX, an EdTech Firm, he has since moved on as the CISO at XXXXXX, an End to End Logistics Solution. I'd met him earlier at a CISO Platform event hosted in Agra, where Ofofo was the official media partner. That event helped us build strong relationships with top CISOs across India - including memorable interactions like a visit to the CISO of Bangalore Airport, who, fun fact, is a Juventus fan with the football club's logo proudly displayed in his office at Terminal 1 of KIAL.</p>
                            <p>Later, We hosted XXXXXX at our studio in Bangalore for a Social Media Campaign we were running for Cybersecurity Awareness Month in Partnership with XXXXXX, one of India's largest cybersecurity service providers. During the visit, I gave him a quick walkthrough of our platform. He loved the idea of fractional consulting, and we scheduled a session to onboard him later that week. He came in around 7:30 PM. That rainy evening turned into a late-night session, we sat working for 4 hours, until close to midnight on a Friday, crafting his offerings, refining his value proposition, planning content, strategizing potential ad campaigns, and shaping our feedback loop to improve product features for vCISOs.</p>
                            <p>Surprisingly, we ended up bonding that night over his personal journey and career, and our shared fondness for travel. We discussed a few routes around Bangalore that he could take his family on for short weekend drives. Luckily, I'm an avid biker myself, and I've taken the time to map out all the locations around Bangalore that I've visited and would love to visit. You should check it out here; I'm sure you or someone from the team would find this excel sheet useful!</p>
                            <p>Interestingly, we also connected over his investing journey. This was particularly exciting for me, as I was just starting out on my own personal journey into the stock market. He shared valuable insights on how to choose stocks and mutual funds, and even explained which government schemes I could use to reduce taxes later in my career. I still remember his words and I've since implemented a few of his strategies as I continue to invest today.</p>
                            <p>One insight from those discussions was that questionnaires were a recurring headache for XXXXXX. Approximately 3-4 questionnaires he had to answer and validate almost daily. It was a problem that he and his peers faced who were also accomplished CISO's. This led us to begin developing an AI compliance tool to help CISOs answer compliance questionnaires faster, reducing the time needed from 2 hours to just 15 minutes per questionnaire by leveraging all existing company documentation. XXXXXX's feedback was instrumental in shaping that tool.</p>
                            <p>Not long after, we sold two 20-hours/Month vCISO consulting packages that included XXXXXX through our outbound efforts, and he brought in a big ticket client as well. I personally led the sales process for that engagement: drafting the RFP, handling proposal milestones, ensuring smooth implementation, and managing all stakeholders. By the end, we had completed a critical Cloudflare migration in under a week, just before the client's previous contract expired, without a single hiccup.</p>
                            <p>Devam's excitement and satisfaction were incredibly rewarding. From being intrigued by a demo to seeing real revenue flow through the platform, it was a full-circle moment. He was pretty impressed that we were able to productize his skills so effectively. That was definitely one of the happiest moments I've seen from a customer, and a proud one for us too.</p>

                            <p>XXXXXX, an Unicorn startup in the HR space that reached out to us just two weeks before a major audit - needing a comprehensive VAPT (Vulnerability Assessment & Penetration Testing) engagement completed end-to-end.</p>
                            <p>Given their size and industry, they required the work to be executed by CERT-In empanelled vendors with top-tier security certifications. The challenge began with a lack of clarity on scope, the client's team wasn't fully aligned internally. It took multiple rounds of calls with various stakeholders on both sides just to finalize the deliverables.</p>
                            <p>Once we had some direction, it was up to me to take full ownership. I sourced and onboarded 7 CERT-In empanelled vendors onto our marketplace through outbound outreach, created a detailed RFP based(as detailed as I could make it at least) on evolving client inputs, and led the vendor selection process. Budget was tight, but I was able to negotiate with the chosen vendor to bring the cost down by 40% in exchange for a logo placement on their website - a win-win, especially since the final price ended up being 25% lower than what the client was prepared to spend.</p>
                            <p>The project remained difficult throughout, with constant scope changes, urgent deliverables, and pressure from multiple directions. Still, I coordinated across all stakeholders, ensured quotes were accurate, and kept the project moving - from proposal approvals to milestone tracking to payment follow-through.</p>
                            <p>In the end, we delivered the VAPT successfully - covering cloud, infra, web, and mobile layers - and hit the audit timeline. Not only did we turn a high-pressure engagement into a win, but we also converted an unicorn into a recurring annual customer. Their feedback later helped us shape feature ideas for our AI-powered compliance assistant.</p>
                            <p>This experience taught me that ambiguity is part of the game, especially in high-pressure enterprise environments. What matters most is the ability to navigate it - by asking the right questions, aligning stakeholders early, and maintaining constant communication. I learned to embrace uncertainty as a challenge to be managed, not avoided, and that momentum often comes from simply taking ownership when no one else does.</p>
                            <p>I also gained a deeper appreciation for creative problem-solving, especially in negotiation. Reducing costs while maintaining value required understanding what the vendor cared about (Brand Visibility) and crafting a win-win solution. Throughout, I realized how crucial it is to strike a balance between structure and flexibility, adapting to evolving requirements while keeping documentation tight, timelines realistic, and approvals clear.</p>
                            <p>Finally, I saw how consistent follow-through, across vendors, clients, and internal teams, builds trust over time. That trust can turn even the most difficult engagements into long-term relationships. The insights and feedback we gained post-project also made it clear that great service isn't just about delivery; it's about learning, iterating, and feeding those lessons back into better product and process design.</p>
